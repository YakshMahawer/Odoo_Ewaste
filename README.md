# Odoo_Ewaste
Our e-waste collection platform connects users with local vendors. Users submit details and photos of their e-waste, and vendors offer prices. After selecting the best option, a delivery service collects the waste. Users earn reward points redeemable for offers, promoting sustainable e-waste management.
